## ABAP setup

To start writing programs in ABAP you will have to get an SAP system. You can get a 
trial account from the SAP website.

I have to found the setup step to be the hardest one. It will test your determination
to learn ABAP and SAP in general. If you complete this step, you may consider yourself
initiated into the SAP business.
