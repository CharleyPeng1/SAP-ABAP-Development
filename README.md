## SAP

SAP stands for Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing and is the name of the corporation that
constructed the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system of the same name. Large and medium sized corporations
use ERP systems to make sure their business is effective and efficient. The purpose of an ERP systems is to
map the business processes such as those in finance, production planning, sales and distribution, material
management and others onto a program that will perform these processes faster, with less error and in greater
volume.

### SAP modules

SAP is divided into modules because it is a very large program that covers almost all business processes. Each
module is distinct and covers only a single area such as Finance(FI), Material Management(MM) or Sales and
Distribution(SD).

### SAP development and customizing

Each trade society, business and corporation has similar processes which are already implemented in SAP modules,
but they need to be fine tuned for each customer. These processes are fine tuned using ABAP to develop special
functionalities that don't exist in a module or to change how an existing process works.

### ABAP

ABAP stands for Advanced Business Application Programming, a programming language similar to COBOL in which
SAP is written. ABAP is used for creating, modifying and extending SAP's programs, so they can accommodate
the different needs of businesses.
