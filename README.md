## SAP

SAP stands for Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing. It is also the name of the corporation that
constructed the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system which goes by the same name.  
Large and medium size corporations use ERP systems to make sure their business is effective and efficient.  

The purpose of an ERP systems is to map the business processes in finance, production planning, sales and
distribution, material management and other areas onto a digital landscape.  
These programs are highly integrated which means they are faster, simpler and have fewer errors then a 
concert of programs implemented by many different vendors.  

### SAP modules

SAP is divided into modules. This is necessary because SAP covers almost all standard business processes.  
Each module is distinct and covers only a single area of business such as Finance(FI), Material Management(MM)
and Sales and Distribution(SD).  

### SAP development and customisation

Businesses have very similar processes which is why they are already implemented in SAP modules.  
However, each business wants these modules fine tuned to their specific needs.  
The processes are fine tuned using the SAP Implementation Guide (IMG). Unfortunately for the client, some of
their requirements are so specific that the only way to implement them is to use a programming language called
ABAP to construct the necessary functionalities.  

### ABAP

ABAP stands for Advanced Business Application Programming, a programming language similar to COBOL.  
SAP is written in ABAP. Therefor, ABAP is used for creating, modifying and extending all programs in SAP.  
Learning ABAP is hard due to the lack of pedagogically sound free tutorials. This is partly why I've decided
to create this repository.  

### Other tools

SAP comes with a large selection of programming tools such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of its own,
graphical document editor called SmartForms, tools that allow SAP to connect and communicate with other system
called ALE as well as testing tools like eCATT.
