## SAP

SAP stands for Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing and is the name of the corporation that
constructed the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system of the same name. Large and medium-large corporations
use ERP systems to make sure their business is effective and efficient. The purpose of ERP systems is to
integrate the business processes such as finance, production planning, sales and distribution and many others
into a single large program.

### SAP modules

SAP is a very large program which is why it is also called a system. Because SAP is so large, SAP is divided
into modules where each module covers only a single process such as Finance(FI) or Material Management(MM).

### Fine tunning

Each trade society, business and corporation (SAP calls them customers) has similar processes which are
already implemented in SAP, but they need to be fine tuned for each customer. This is where ABAP comes in.

### ABAP

ABAP stands for Advanced Business Application Programming and is a programming language most similar to COBOL.
It is used for creating, modifying and extending SAP's programs, so they can accommodate the different needs
of businesses.

### Other tools

SAP is so huge that listing all tool for customizing, development and enhancement would be too laborious.
