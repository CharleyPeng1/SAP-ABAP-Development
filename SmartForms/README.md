## SmartForms

SmartForms are used for the same purpose as SAPscript, they specify how text is
printed onto a piece of paper. SmartFroms have better graphics and their
programs are smaller and more modular. SmartForms are made up from three
elements: form, style and print program.

SF_STYLE_01: Training Example

### SmartForms Vocabulary

The form defines windows and texts, controls the print flow and where the basic
elements are located.

Style defines the look of the text.

Print programs defines how and which tables will be filled with data from the
database tables.

Function module can be generated automatically based on the defined style and
form. The function module replaces the composer program in SAPscript.

SmartForm settings: SMARTFORMS, Utilities, Settings.

### Create SmartForms form

Never change an existing SmartForm form, copy it and create a Z named form. You
can create a new, empty SmartForm. SmartForms are divided into Global Settings
and Pages and Windows.

### SmartForms Global Settings

Form attributes allow you to specify translation options and output options.

Form interface defines the input and output parameters which are used to
exchange data with the print program, a program that will prepare and pass data
to the SmartForm.

Global definitions are where variables and structures are defined and declared
for this particular SmartForm.

### SmartForms Pages and Windows

Pages and windows define the visual look of the SmartForm using nodes.

### Nodes

Nodes say in what order, what text and where it will be printed. Nodes share
some attributes, but many of them have special attributes that need to be
configured to fine tune the node. Most nodes can have subnodes.

Nodes are divided into groups based on what they do:
- Display nodes - Page, Window, Template and Table all have the ability to be
displayed.
- Elementary nodes - Text, Graphics and Address cannot have subnodes.
- Flow Control nodes - these nodes define conditions and paths in which the
SmartForm will be generated.

Nodes are created by right-clicking the existing nodes and then clicking create.

### Field list

Field list allows fields to be drag and dropped, which speeds up SmartForms
development.

### SmarfForms form testing

SmartFdorms form are tested in the same way ordinary programs are tested. Click
Execute, then the SmartForm will generate a function module. The function module
can then be tested by clicking Execute again. You will be prompted to select an
OutputDevice and you should choose LP01 for the purposes of testing and click
print preview. This will show you an example of show the SmartForm will look on
paper.

### SmartForm Print Program

SmartForms generate a function module that fills it will data, but you still
have to make an ABAP program that will give the function module the required
data. That program is called a print program. All print program are similar in
that they all need to select data from a table, then modify the data if necessary.
After the data has been prepared, the program has to find the name of the
funtion module that the SmartForm has generated by invoking
'SSF_FUNCTION_MODULE_NAME'. The function will return the function module name
and then it will be invoked and given the prepared data. Take a look at the
example print program at the bottom.  

### SmartForm translation

SmartForms can be translated through SE63. Once there, select Tools, R/3 Enterprise,
Other Long Texts. If you cannot find this, use Translations, ABAP Object,
Other Long Texts, then find Smart Form in the tree and select it. There you
will be able to name the target language and the object you want to translate.

### More on nodes

- Page - what will be the next page (more often then not, the first page will
point to the next page and then the next page will point to itself), other
options are self explanatory.

- Window - divide a page into print areas. There has to be one and only one MAIN
window on each page. Most other windows should be secondary. Conditions can be
defined to say when this window can be printed out. To "comment" the window, set
an impossible condition such as 1=0.

- Template - for printing tables whose content is known in advance (the number of
rows and columns must be constant). You can use both the Details and Table
Painter to define the template. The template needs subnodes that will fill it
will data.

- Table - prints table data of unknown size. Comes with three subnodes by default.
You have to define the table source by setting an internal table and line. Line
is defined in the global definitions and the table is defined in the form
interface(note: you cannot declare it a table type, instead you must define it
as a table line type. If the line type doesn't exist, you have to define it in
the Dictionary.) You can also perform calculations such as sum.

- Text - prints text. There are three subtypes of text: Text Element, Include
Text and Text Module. The text can be a New Paragraph, New Line or can be
Appended Directly.
    - Text Element - text is written manually. Variables (grey) can be added using
    Field list through drag and drop (if you are not using the MSWord) or
    surround the variable name with &VAR& and then delete the <,>,) supresor
    chars in the other editor. If in a template, you have to define the row and
    column if you want the element to be displayed.
    
    - Include Text - text from existing SAPscripts.
    
    - Text Module - perhaps the most useful element as it can be transported and
    translated. Created on the same screen on which a SmartForm or Style would
    be created.

- Address - a special node that allows data to be printed in ISO format. Based on
SAP's Central Address Management.

- Graphics - pictures can be uploaded using SE78 and then they can be used as
background pictures, logos or graphs.

- Program lines - avoid them. If you can't, use them with caution.

### SmartForms Text Module

Created in SMARTFORMS. It can be used in many SmartForms.
    
### Copying nodes

If a node is copied then the copy will be a reference to the original.
Everything that is changed in the original will also be changed in the copy.

### Change text editor type

SE38 and enter RSCPSETEDITOR. Do not ignore the warning.

## SmartForm Styles

Makes text pretty...
