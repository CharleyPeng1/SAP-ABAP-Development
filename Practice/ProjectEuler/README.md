## [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler is an archive of hundreds of mathematical problems that can only be elegantly solved using a computer
program. These problems are tailor made for learning the basic syntax of a language as well as for practicing code
modularization.

### Solutions

Each solution has its own file who's name corresponds to the ID of the problem in the archive. Some functions were
extracted and put into their own file as well.
